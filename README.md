### Project description

This project was developed during a selection process offered by Konia Tecnologia. The development of an API for registering and listing products was requested. The API code was written in Python using the Django framework. An interface developed in React.js was also required. The interface is a complement to the API, it has a main screen where all the products that are saved in the database are rendered, in addition to a button for inserting new products. [Access the API repository by clicking here](https://github.com/renandcr/konia_project).
